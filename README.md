# HaskGB

This is a learning project for me, meant to have a larger scope than any of 
my previous Haskell projects and help me learn how to put them together on a 
bigger scale.


## Building

I use cabal to build my projects, and with the release of the tool and 
library version 2.4 the new-style commands are in place and expected to be 
used.  To build the project use `cabal new-build`, `cabal new-run` to 
run the executable, and `cabal new-haddock` to build the docs.
